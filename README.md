## Notes based on above video:

### 7 steps to solve algroithm problems:

1. Listen carefully to problem.
2. Come up with good examples.
3. Come up with brute force algorithm.
4. Optimize your solution.
5. Walk through your algorithm.
6. Start coding.
7. Test your code.

### 3 Algorithm strategy

1. B.U.D.
  > - Bottleneck - Identify bottleneck & get rid of it.
  > - Unnecessary work - Pay attention to small break and optimization
  > - Duplicated work - Look for duplicated work and optimize.
  > - **Walk through bruteforce**

2. Space/ Time Tradeoff
  > - Using different data structure and try to solve the problem
  > - **Hashtables** are often used for this purpose

3. D.I.Y.
  > - Do it yourself
  > - Use large generic example
